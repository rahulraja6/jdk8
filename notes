Default methods
	One of the major reason for introducing default methods in interfaces is to enhance the Collections API in Java 8 to support lambda expressions.
	Nearest default method gets precedence in hierarchy
	Java interface static method is similar to default method except that we can’t override them in the implementation classes.
	Java interface static method helps us in providing security by not allowing implementation classes to override them.
	default methods cannot override Object class methods
	We can’t define interface static method for Object class methods, we will get compiler error as “This static method cannot hide the instance method from Object”. This is because it’s not allowed in java, since Object is the base class for all the classes and we can’t have one class level static method and another instance method with same signature.
